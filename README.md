# maps--for-life
Doubling down on the Map(), attacking from all angles on how to use it to create new arrays.
The map() and forEach() methods are very similar. Both methods iterate through an array and apply a function to each element. The main difference is that map() returns a new array, while forEach() doesn't return anything.

So which method should you use? Generally, itâ€™s better to use forEach() if you don't need to change the values in the original array. forEach() is a good choice if all you need to do is log each element of an array to the console, or save them to a database.

On the other hand, map() is a better choice if you need to update the values in the original array. It's especially useful if you want to store the updated array as a variable and keep the original as a reference.
